  <p>I had an idea for a camera app that lets you shoot photorealistic vector pictures.</p>

_I come up with new ideas all the time. Some are good, some just plain absurd. Sure enough though, I don't have enough time to work on all of them. Since I don't like ideas to go to waste, I'm sharing them publicly on my blog._

When I came across the incredible art of [Kirk Moffatt](https://www.vectorvondoodle.com/) (aka [Vector Von Doodle](https://www.instagram.com/vectorvondoodle/)), I was immediately blown away by the level of realism he managed to achieve with vector graphics. Check out some examples of his work:

{% image "./tron-legacy.jpg", "Tron Legacy poster by Kirk Moffatt" %}

{% image "./hijack.jpg", "Hijack poster by Kirk Moffatt" %}

{% image "./moon-knight.jpg", "Moon Knight poster by Kirk Moffatt" %}

Creating such images requires a crazy amount of work, so I asked myself _"What if my camera could take pictures in vector format instead of raster?"_

**Introducing: Vector Snap.** A camera app that shoots ultra-realistic vector pictures instead of raster images.

I thought about a mobile app because it's more practical to build and distribute, but think how cool it would be to have a physical camera that could shoot vector! I would 100% choose that over an app.

And why limit the functionality to still frames? Imagine being able to shoot videos that look like [A Scanner Darkly (2006)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405296/).

How difficult would it be to build something like this? Quite a lot, I imagine, but with the right computational power it shouldn't be impossible.
