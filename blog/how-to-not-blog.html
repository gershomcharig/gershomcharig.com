      According to the Wayback Machine, I've been the proud owner of this domain
      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120220231348/http://www.gershomcharig.com/">since 2012</a>. It's been my
      trusty design portfolio, but in a certain way, more akin to a chronicle of my haircuts: neglected most of the
      time, it would receive a visual refresh every time I started looking around for a new job and needed to impress
      potential employers. In its various iterations, it would usually feature a short bio, some snapshots of my best
      work (now shamelessly replaced by a few links to Figma prototypes), and a "Contact" button. It has served me well
      so far, but I've always cultivated the idea of this being something more than just a portfolio. I wanted this to
      be <strong>a place where I could express myself</strong>. Unfortunately, I'm so lazy that I've been tinkering with
      this idea <em>for years</em>... Until now.
    </p>
    <p><strong>My website finally has a blog.</strong> Well, kind of.</p>
    <h2 id="how-i-got-here">How I got here</h2>
    <p>
      I tend to jump in and out of what I call "creative phases": days or weeks where my brain frantically produces
      ideas, where a sudden optimism leads me to believe that I will be super productive, and that <em>this time</em>
      the phase will never end. But it always ends, and usually, it leaves me feeling like a failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beginning of 2024 has been quite tough on me, and somehow finding myself again in one of these creative phases
      helped me stay positive. I guess the mix of these two conditions allowed me to gather enough courage and
      motivation to finally
      <em>do something</em>
      with this website. Like adding a blog and actually writing something in it. As expected, I found myself stuck, as
      many other times before, sabotaging my own plans with pointless doubts.
      <em
        >Should I write a few posts first or build the blog? What's the fastest SSG around? The website obviously needs
        a redesign. And a new logo. And what about dark mode?</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Fuck dark mode. This time I told myself that there were no excuses for not putting a few words out in the wild.
      True to my pragmatic personality, I resolved to add a blog to my website in the most simple, efficient, and
      frictionless way I know:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>I wrote my first post in plain HTML (you are reading it at this very moment);</li>
      <li>I added a link to it on the homepage;</li>
      <li>Commit, push.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      That's it. No SSG, no JavaScript, no CSS. I can't even tell if someone's reading it (if you are, blink twice). I
      haven't checked yet, but I'm pretty sure this page performs well on every browser, even with a terrible internet
      connection. But none of these things matter, only the content does.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obviously, I'm not suggesting that everyone should build a blog this way. You probably shouldn't. See, my priority
      was to break the impasse and get the ball rolling. Sometimes you need radical solutions to beat inertia. "Do
      things that don't scale", as Paul Graham said. This is what I really needed, and I'm glad I did it this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      This blog will get nicer, eventually. Now that I have some content to care about, I have an excuse to tinker with
      frameworks, layouts, typefaces, and logos. I could even add a dark mode. And if there's ever going to be a post
      no. 2, big win.
    </p>
    <h2 id="why-you-should-read-this-blog">Why you should read this blog</h2>
    <p>
      My goal is to write content that is inspiring and thought-provoking. I won't be writing exclusively about one
      topic. I'm an eclectic person, and my website should reflect that. This blog is meant to be, in a sort of way, an
      extension of my mind and personality. I will share ideas, opinions, thoughts, as well as reviews on software,
      gadgets, and books that I like. I might even post some photos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most importantly,
      <strong>everything I'll post will always be something that I'm genuinely excited to share</strong>. And I promise
      every word you'll read here will come straight from my own hands, which in this world of AI-generated and
      SEO-optimised content, almost feels like a subversive act of rebellion. That's right, writing your own blog posts
      is the new punk rock.
    </p>
    <h2 id="why-i-am-doing-this">Why I am doing this</h2>
    <p>
      I have a few good reasons for starting a personal blog. I yearn to share and connect, but social networks are not
      exactly my cup of tea. They feel to me like a noisy market where everyone's shouting for attention, the mayor's
      holding the volume knob, and ads are always the loudest. I want to be in control, own the content I produce, and I
      think a personal blog in my own cozy corner of the internet might be just the right vehicle for that. It's also
      quite a brilliant excuse for ruminating on topics that I'm curious about but that I couldn't otherwise justify
      spending time on.
    </p>
    <p>
      And let's not forget that this might be the last chance to build something uniquely original before natural
      language interfaces become the default way to browse the internet and people like me start designing websites for
      AIs instead of humans.
